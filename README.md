Hallo, ich bin Plutope!

I am interested in modding VR games.
I am currently learning C++.
If you would like to give me help/tips/knowledge to help me learn that would be much appreciated.
To contact me my Discord is @Plutope#0670

Gorilla Tag and Beat Saber mods are really interesting to me, because they are different, but help me learn the other.
